# BOOKING-POC

A travel booking system with seat availability management and time-limited cart expiration.

## Use Case

Implement a checkout process for users to buy a Travel where:

- the user can select a travel to book;
- the user inputs an email and the number of seats to reserve;
- the user pays the total amount to confirm the booking (FAKE payment step);

### Requirements

- A Travel has a max capacity of 5 seats total;
- After confirming the number of seats to reserve the availability should be granted for 15 minutes before the cart expires;

**Note:** Implementing a back-office or the integration with a real payment provider is NOT a requirement.

## Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Structure

The project uses **pnpm workspaces** to manage a simple and lightweight monorepo:

### Why pnpm Workspaces?

For a POC of this size, this project uses **pnpm workspaces** instead of more complex tools like NX or Turborepo because:

- âœ… **Simplicity**: Zero extra configuration, immediate setup
- âœ… **Native**: No additional dependencies or boilerplate
- âœ… **Sufficient**: Perfect for 2 packages (backend + frontend)
- âœ… **Readable**: Clean code without complex tooling overhead

### Why REST instead of GraphQL?

GraphQL could be added later. The project starts with REST because:

- âœ… Faster to implement for a POC
- âœ… Less setup and initial configuration
- âœ… Simpler for project evaluators
- âœ… Easy migration to GraphQL in the future

### Docker Compose Services

```yaml
services:
  postgres:      # PostgreSQL Database (port 5432)
  backend:       # NestJS API (port 3000)
  frontend:      # Nuxt 3 App (port 3001)
  swagger-ui:    # API Documentation (port 8080)
```

---

## Database Schema

**Core entities:** `travels` and `bookings`

**Travels table:** Stores travel information (name, description, dates, price, moods) with fixed `totalSeats` of 5.

**Bookings table:** Tracks reservations with status (`pending`, `confirmed`, `expired`, `cancelled`), email, seats count, and `expiresAt` timestamp for pending bookings.

**Key implementation details:**

- Availability calculated real-time by summing all `pending` + `confirmed` bookings per travel
- Concurrency handled with database transactions and row-level locking (`FOR UPDATE`)
- Proper indexing on `(travelId, status)` and `expiresAt` for performance

---

## REST API Documentation

Complete API documentation is available in OpenAPI 3.0 format:

**ðŸ“„ [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)** - Full API specification with:

- All endpoints (Travels, Bookings)
- Request/Response schemas
- Validation rules
- Error responses
- Interactive documentation via Swagger UI

### API Overview

**Travels:**

- `GET /api/travels` - List all travels (with pagination)
- `GET /api/travels/:slug` - Get travel details with availability

**Bookings:**

- `POST /api/bookings/reserve` - Reserve seats (creates pending booking)
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get booking details with remaining time
- `POST /api/bookings/:id/confirm` - Confirm booking with fake payment
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Cancel pending booking

### Swagger UI

When running the application with Docker Compose, access interactive API documentation at:

**ðŸ”— <http://localhost:8080>**

You can test all endpoints directly from the browser.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **pnpm** (optional, for local development)
- **Node.js >=22.19** (optional, for local development)

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd booking-poc

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Or with rebuild
docker-compose up --build
```

Available services:

- **Frontend**: <http://localhost:3001>
- **Backend API**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **Swagger UI**: <http://localhost:8080>
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432

### Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
pnpm install

# Start only PostgreSQL with Docker
docker-compose up postgres

# In separate terminals:
pnpm dev:backend    # http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev:frontend   # http://localhost:3001
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Available pnpm Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start Docker Compose (all services)
pnpm dev:backend      # Start only backend (local)
pnpm dev:frontend     # Start only frontend (local)

# Build
pnpm build            # Build all workspaces
pnpm build:backend    # Build only backend
pnpm build:frontend   # Build only frontend

# Testing
pnpm test             # Test all workspaces
pnpm test:backend     # Test only backend
pnpm test:frontend    # Test only frontend

# Linting
pnpm lint             # Lint all workspaces

# Database
pnpm db:seed          # Seed database with sample data
pnpm db:migrate       # Run migrations
pnpm db:reset         # Reset database
```

### How Workspaces Work

- `pnpm -r <command>` â†’ Runs the command in **all** workspaces
- `pnpm --filter <name> <command>` â†’ Runs the command **only** in the specified workspace
- `pnpm install` â†’ Installs dependencies for all workspaces with intelligent hoisting

---

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Business logic (services, utilities)
- **Integration Tests**: REST endpoints with in-memory database
- **E2E Tests**: Complete booking flow
- **Concurrency Tests**: Simultaneous booking scenarios

### Frontend Testing

- **Component Tests**: Vitest for Vue components
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for complete user flows

---

## Evaluation Points

As required by the specification, the project focuses on:

- âœ… **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, linting, formatting
- âœ… **Code Readability**: Naming conventions, clear structure, comments where needed
- âœ… **Testing**: Adequate coverage with unit, integration and E2E tests
- âœ… **Solution Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable, separation of concerns
- âœ… **Reasoning**: Documented decisions (ADR) and commented
- âœ… **Documentation**: Complete README, API docs, inline comments
- âœ… **UI/UX Patterns**: Responsive design, loading states, error handling, user feedback

---

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR-001: Monorepo with pnpm Workspaces

**Context**: Need to manage backend and frontend in a single repository.

**Decision**: Use pnpm workspaces instead of NX or Turborepo.

**Rationale**: For a POC with 2 packages, pnpm workspaces offers simplicity without sacrificing functionality. Zero configuration overhead.

### ADR-002: REST API as Starting Point

**Context**: Choice between REST and GraphQL for APIs.

**Decision**: Start with REST, add GraphQL later.

**Rationale**: Faster implementation, less setup, not prior experience in the team (me), easy migration in the future. GraphQL can be added as a layer on top of REST.

### ADR-003: Docker Compose for Orchestration

**Context**: Need to run PostgreSQL, backend and frontend together.

**Decision**: Use Docker Compose for complete environment.

**Rationale**: Zero-configuration setup for project evaluators. Consistency across environments. Local development still possible.

### ADR-004: Expiration with Scheduled Job

**Context**: Handle booking expiration after 15 minutes.

**Decision**: Cron job that checks and expires bookings every minute.

**Rationale**: Simple, reliable, doesn't require external state. Alternative (DB-level TTL) considered but more complex.

### ADR-005: Prisma ORM for Database Layer

**Context**: Need to choose database access approach: TypeORM, Prisma, or no ORM.

**Decision**: Use Prisma ORM for the database layer.

**Rationale**: Type-safe client with excellent DX, reliable migrations, and minimal boilerplate. Perfect for POC velocity. Trade-off: vendor lock-in acceptable for this scale.

### ADR-006: Nuxt UI for Component Library

**Context**: Need UI components for frontend development.

**Decision**: Use Nuxt UI as the component library.

**Rationale**: Official Nuxt library with pre-built accessible components, form validation, and auto-import. Saves ~15-20 hours vs custom. Trade-off: ~100KB bundle size acceptable for POC.

### ADR-007: Domain-Driven Design Approach

**Context**: Need architectural pattern for organizing business logic maintainably.

**Decision**: Apply DDD principles with pragmatic simplification for POC scale.

**Rationale**: Backend organized by domain modules (booking, travel, payment). Entity-rich model with business logic. Repository pattern for testability. Simplified: flat structure, minimal Value Objects, no strict CQRS. Balance between DDD principles and development velocity.
